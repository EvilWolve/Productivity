This is a prototype for a productivity app/game.

The app consists of a productivity layer and a game layer. In the productivity layer, the user manages tasks as in most task tracking and
productivity applications. Completing tasks awards the user points that they can then spend in the game layer, where their characters can
progress and grow just as the user does in the real world.

The idea behind it is that games such as city builders or idle games draw the player back into the game to spend the resources they have
gained in their absence. Instead of handing out rewards for letting the game idle and coming back, why not reward the user for completing
tasks in the meantime? The core idea, that the game doesn't progress much in the user's absence, still remains; however the only way to
progress is by being productive, not just idle.
